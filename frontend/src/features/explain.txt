features/ (The Core Engine)
This is where 80% of your application lives. Instead of putting all "Components" in one folder, you group them by domain.

Why: If your "Feed" logic breaks, you know exactly which folder to look in. It isolates complexity.

Billionaire Mindset: This is modular leverage. It allows you to scale the product by adding new features without breaking existing ones.
