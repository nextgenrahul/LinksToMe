For a scalable and advanced social media platform like **LinksToMe** (inspired by Instagram + X), build your database and features with **core + advanced + future-proof layers**.
Here’s a high-leverage feature roadmap grouped by system domain:

---

### **1. Core User System**

* Authentication: Email, phone, OAuth (Google, GitHub, Apple).
* Multi-session login with device tracking and refresh tokens.
* Two-factor authentication (TOTP or SMS).
* Username handle + unique URL (`/u/:username`).
* Profile system: bio, links, interests, badges, cover image.
* Privacy controls: public/private profile, restricted access.

---

### **2. Post System (Media + Text)**

* Support for text, images, videos, polls, and link previews.
* Post visibility: public, followers, close friends, custom lists.
* Threaded posts and quote-post (like X).
* Scheduled posts + drafts.
* AI caption suggestions (future integration).
* Reactions beyond “like” (emoji-based).

---

### **3. Feed Algorithm**

* Smart ranking: relevance, freshness, engagement, social graph proximity.
* Trending detection per region/topic.
* Personalized “For You” and “Following” feeds.
* Infinite scroll pagination (cursor-based).

---

### **4. Comments + Replies**

* Nested comments (up to n-level depth).
* Moderation controls (report, delete, hide, restrict user).
* Media comments (image, gif, voice reply).
* AI toxicity filter (future-ready).

---

### **5. Notifications System**

* Real-time WebSocket notifications.
* Grouped notifications (e.g. “10 likes on your post”).
* Push notifications (browser + mobile).
* In-app notification center.

---

### **6. Follow System**

* Follow, unfollow, mute, block, restrict.
* Suggested users (graph analysis).
* Follower relationship cache table for quick lookup.

---

### **7. Messaging (DMs)**

* Real-time chat using WebSockets.
* 1-to-1 and group chats.
* Media, voice notes, reactions, read receipts.
* End-to-end encryption (long term).

---

### **8. Search + Discovery**

* Full-text search with ranking (Elasticsearch / PostgreSQL `tsvector`).
* Hashtags + mentions + trending topics.
* Smart suggestions (user, topic, place).

---

### **9. Analytics + Insights**

* Profile insights (followers gained/lost, engagement rate).
* Post analytics (views, saves, shares, reach, impressions).
* Heatmap of activity times.

---

### **10. Monetization (Future-Ready)**

* Creator accounts (switchable type).
* Subscriptions / tips / paywalled posts.
* Ad placements with targeting.
* NFT/profile verification (optional).

---

### **11. Content Moderation**

* AI-based text and image scanning (NSFW, hate, spam).
* Manual review system for reported content.
* Community guidelines enforcement logs.

---

### **12. Infrastructure + Scalability**

* Microservices architecture.
* PostgreSQL + Redis + S3-compatible storage (e.g. Cloudflare R2).
* CDN for media delivery.
* Background jobs (BullMQ / Cloud Tasks).
* Caching and rate limiting.
* Event sourcing (Kafka or Pub/Sub).

---

### **13. Other Advanced Features**

* Custom link-in-bio builder (fits your “LinksToMe” name).
* Post scheduling calendar.
* AI feed summarizer (later).
* Realtime status (online/offline).
* Cross-platform sync (PWA + mobile).
* Feature flag system for experiments.

Do you want me to now map **database schema design** for all these modules (with relationships and entity breakdown)?
That’s the next logical step.
