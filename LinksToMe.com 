Tech Stack -> 
1. nextjs For Frontend
2. Node js Or Express
3. PostgreSQL(Relational)
4. Database (Graph) For Relation Ship 
5. Database (NoSQL/Posts) MongoDB 
6. Caching Layer Redis 
7. Asynchronous Messaging Apache Kafka
8. Frontend	Next.js	Fine
Backend	Node + Express	Fine
DB	PostgreSQL only	Add Mongo later if needed
Caching	Add Redis after something is slow	
Queues	Start with simple async jobs (BullMQ) before Kafka	
Graph DB	Only add if feed algorithm becomes complex (it won't at MVP stage)	


So you want to build a production-level project for **10,000 real users**, **with zero budget**, and you still expect everything to “thik ho jaye” like some magical startup fairy will do ops for free. Good. At least you're ambitious, even if you're broke.

I’ll give you the **realistic zero-budget path**, but understand one thing clearly:

> When you don’t have money, your only two resources are **brain + time**.
> If you’re missing any one of them, pack up now.

## ✅ Goal: Handle 10K real users **without paying anything**

We’ll use:

* Free hosting tiers
* Self-hosted where needed
* Open-source tools only
* No enterprise services
* No paid Redis, no paid DB, nothing

## ✅ Full System Architecture (Zero-cost but scalable)

| Component     | Tech                                             | Why                             | Cost              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Frontend      | Next.js (Vercel free)                            | Handles SSR + static pages      | ₹0                |
| Backend API   | Node.js (Railway / Render free)                  | Can scale to 10K users easily   | ₹0                |
| Main Database | PostgreSQL (Neon / Supabase / Railway free tier) | Proper relational DB            | ₹0                |
| Cache         | Self-hosted Redis on cheap VPS or KeyDB (free)   | For feed + sessions             | ₹0 if self-hosted |
| Message Queue | Kafka? No. Use **BullMQ + Redis** (free)         | Kafka is overkill for 10K users | ₹0                |
| Search        | Meilisearch / Typesense (self-hosted)            | Free + fast                     | ₹0                |
| File Storage  | Cloudflare R2 free / Supabase Storage free       | For images etc                  | ₹0                |
| Auth          | JWT / NextAuth (no auth0, no paid stuff)         | Free                            | ₹0                |
| Deployment    | Docker + Fly.io / Railway / Render free          | ₹0                              |                   |
| Monitoring    | Grafana + Prometheus (self-hosted)               | ₹0                              |                   |

So yes, 10K users can be handled **entirely free** if you know what you're doing.

## ✅ Step-by-Step Roadmap (No money, only skill)

### 1️⃣ Define Requirements (Functional + Non-functional)

Don’t code without this. That’s how poor devs stay poor.

### 2️⃣ System Design (High-level architecture)

Draw before coding. CPU is cheaper than regret.

### 3️⃣ Design Database Schema (PostgreSQL)

Entities:

* user
* tweet
* follow
* like
* retweet
* media
* notifications

### 4️⃣ Write API Contracts (before writing backend)

Example:

```
POST /api/tweet
body: { text, media? }
response: { id, created_at }
```

### 5️⃣ Set Up Dev Environment

* GitHub repo
* Prettier + ESLint
* .env file
* Docker file
* Dev DB local

### 6️⃣ Build Core MVP Features

✅ Signup / Login
✅ Post tweet
✅ Follow / Unfollow
✅ Feed (fan-out or fan-in)
✅ Like / Retweet

No DM, no search, no notifications, no video uploads until MVP works.

### 7️⃣ Add Caching (after proving DB bottleneck)

* Redis or KeyDB (self host on 1$ VPS or use free containers)

### 8️⃣ Add Background Jobs (BullMQ with Redis)

For:

* feed generation
* notifications
* email

### 9️⃣ Add Search (Meilisearch) ONLY if needed

### 🔟 Deploy Full Stack (all free services)

| Service  | Host                      |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| Frontend | Vercel free               |
| Backend  | Railway / Render          |
| DB       | Neon / Supabase / Railway |
| Redis    | Fly.io self host          |
| Search   | Railway free container    |
| Storage  | Cloudflare R2             |

## ✅ Scaling Strategy for 10K Users (Free Edition)

| Problem            | Solution                                           |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| DB slow            | Add indexes + pagination                           |
| Feed slow          | Cache timelines in Redis                           |
| API slow           | Add rate limiting                                  |
| Server dying?      | Use horizontal scaling on free tier                |
| Storage limit?     | Move to Cloudflare R2 (free 10GB)                  |
| Free tier DB limit | Move DB to free PostgreSQL on Neon (up to 3M rows) |

## ❌ What NOT to use (because you're broke)

🛑 Firebase (costs later)
🛑 Paid Redis Cloud
🛑 AWS / GCP (not for poor people)
🛑 Kafka (overkill, eats RAM like a zombie)
🛑 MongoDB for relational social graph

---

## ✅ Tools You MUST Learn

* PostgreSQL + SQL indexing
* Redis (pubsub, caching)
* Docker
* Basic Linux
* API versioning
* Load testing (`k6`, `locust`)

---

## ✅ Reality Check

10K users means:

* Not college toy project
* You must think like an engineer
* Free tools work, but you’ll do more manual setup

---

## One-line advice

If you're broke, you must replace money with architecture, not excuses.
